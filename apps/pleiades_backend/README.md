# Project Pleiades Backend

The celestial backend services for Project Pleiades, built with NestJS to orchestrate our distributed intelligence network.

## Description

This backend service acts as the cosmic bridge between our various stellar components:
- Manages communication with the Pleiades Core
- Handles user authentication and session management
- Provides API endpoints for the frontend constellation
- Orchestrates blockchain interactions and data processing
- Maintains the distributed database of cosmic knowledge

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running the Celestial Services

```bash
# development constellation
$ yarn run start

# watch mode for rapid stellar evolution
$ yarn run start:dev

# production deployment
$ yarn run start:prod
```

## Testing the Cosmic Web

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn run test

# end-to-end constellation tests
$ yarn run test:e2e

# test coverage mapping
$ yarn run test:cov
```

## Database Management

```bash
# create a new migration
$ yarn run migrate:dev

# deploy migrations
$ yarn run migrate:deploy

# reset the cosmic database
$ yarn run migrate:reset

# generate Prisma client
$ yarn run prisma:generate

# explore the database through Prisma Studio
$ yarn run prisma:studio
```

## Architecture

The backend is built using:
- NestJS for the core framework
- Prisma for database management
- Redis for real-time communication
- Socket.IO for WebSocket connections
- BullMQ for job queues
- Various blockchain SDKs for crypto operations
